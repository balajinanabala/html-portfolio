<h2>My top 3 movies of all time</h2>
<h3>Bahubali 1</h3>
<p>This is the first Indian movie collected more than 1000 crores all over the word, movie making is the best and hatsup to Rajamouli. The movie took Prabhas to the list of Super Heroes.</p>
<h3>RRR</h3>
<p>Another best movie of Rajamouli. The action of Junior NTR and Ramcharan is fantastic and the best ever. This is first time, the indian song Natu Natu won the Oscar Award</p>   
<h3>Hi Nanna</h3>
<p>The is one of the best movies of hero Nani I have seen. The story, screenplay and the direction deserves top rating. The first time director has made the movie so different from other routine movies. The heroine Mrunal acted so well, the child artist's action was fantastic. I watched this movie from the beginning to end with complete focus  </p>
